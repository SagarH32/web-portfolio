        <h3>World Class web dev</h3>
        <p>I’m a self-taught developer, I tried college a few times a few years ago, to never succeed there, I was always getting bored at the classrooms and it just wasn’t for me. However thanks to the amazing world of the internet I was able to learn all my skills and become a great software engineer. </p>
